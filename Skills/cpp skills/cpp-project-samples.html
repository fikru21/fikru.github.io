            <p>I took the course c++ when I was a second semisotr at freshman year, after we get back from corona break
                we didn't learn that much of c++ but we had some labs, and I loves c++ programing language and I learned a lot
                from it but we never did any projects in it so I don't have my project samples to show you.
