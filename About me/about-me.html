            <br><br><br>
            My younger brothers name is kalabe Dessalegn we call him Kalu, Kalisha, kelaw for short. he is the last and the younger son of the family. because he is the last son he might be a little bit spoiled.
            <br>
            He is a grade 11 student currently and he is also a claver student. He like to watch  movies and play video games may be too much. Hes into Action movies.
            He  still don't have a girlfriend not that I know of but their are a lot of girls who have a crash on him.
            When am spending time with him we compet alot, what can I say I'm bit competitive.
            Most of the time him and I  fights a lot but he is the most one I miss when I'm away, and no matter how we disagree at the end of the day he is my little brother and my best friend.
            <br><br><br>
            The other member of our family is my aunt, Her name is Meseret Kebede. she is my mothers sister and she has been with us most of our childhood,
             basicly she is like our mother.
            <br>
            She loves Kalu so much, I think its because she has been around when he was born. though she loves all of us so much and we love her too. 
            <br><br><br><br>
            When we circle back to me I grew up in a neighbour called Adago, because its so near to the secondary school I was familier with the school members in cluding the teachers.
            so if I had made one problem my mother would hear about it.
            <br>
            My hobbies are  doing sports, writing, playing with my friends, and I also like playing football. growing up we had a football club named 'pre united', we never made it to the finals.
            <br>
            I also like going to church and spending time their praying and doing some God's work, though am not a relly perfect at it.
            <br>
            Until I was grade 8 I learn at school called ' Etege Tayetu Btul ' primary school , sheq Alamudin the wealthies guy in Ethiopia learned their.
            I made some cool friends their though I don't know what they are doing rigth now , I doubt it the will remember me if we met currently.
            After I attend my secondary school education i took the national exam after finishing grade 12 then I scored 469 point, then I took the test to join the 
            Adama science and technology University.
            <br>Currently I am a student of ASTU studying in the Department of ECE on Electrical Engineering School.
